# 🎬 Unveiling the Director’s Vision: A Deep Dive into Movie Data Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This collaborative Data Science project explores how directors, budgets, genres, and release timing influence movie success. Using scraped IMDb data and machine learning techniques, our team of five analyzed performance trends to guide decision-making in the film industry.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- 🎥 Director names
- 💰 Movie budgets
- 🎭 Genres
- 📅 Release dates
- 💵 Box office earnings
- ⭐ IMDb ratings

## 🔍 Objectives
- Pinpoint which directors consistently drive commercial and critical success
- Model the impact of budget and genre on box office performance
- Analyze seasonal release trends
- Provide actionable insights for studios and producers
